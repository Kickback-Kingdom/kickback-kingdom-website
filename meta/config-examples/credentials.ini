; To have a properly working server, this config file must be filled out
; and placed into one of these places on the system:
;   /etc/kickback-kingdom/credentials.ini
;   /srv/kickback-kingdom/credentials.ini
;
; The most important thing is probably going to be the SQL user+password,
; along with having a working MySQL/MariaDB database set up on the host
; machine and with _at least_ the `kickbackdb` schema loaded.
;
; The other auth info can probably be elided on dev environments, but will
; prevent those features from working, and possibly create crashes whenever
; something tries to use a feature or integration that uses one of those
; services.
