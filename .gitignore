# Ignore backup files
#
# These are usually made by text editors or IDEs, but you can use these
# extensions manually to evict temporary backups from the git tree.
#
# Exception: Some of the files in the `meta` folder might be considered
# to be "backups" in some sense (ex: backups of server config, backup
# of database schema, etc). These intentional+permanent backups should
# NOT be ignored, as we _want_ those to be IN the git tree. Conveniently
# enough, those do not have the below excluded extensions, but instead
# just use their normal extensions like `.conf` and `.mysql`.

# This exclusion is convenient for anyone that wants to run phpMyAdmin from
# their local HTTP server while the Kickback Kingdom website is still
# available for testing. (Ex: you'd put your phpMyAdmin folder at
# `./html/phpmyadmin`, then have your browser navigate to `http://localhost/index.php`
# to access your development version of the Kickback Kingdom website, or
# have your browser navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php` to
# access phpMyAdmin, all without having to switch out what folder the
# HTTP server is hosting.)
