// While this isn't the earliest initscript in the init process,
// it IS the earliest one that we can feel comfortable editing.
//
// There are still caveats that will persist throughout init scripts:
// * File-scoped variables should not be used.
// * Classes should not be used.
//
// Init scripts are really only for things that absolutely can't be done
// elsewhere (ex: can't be done in classes because the class autoloader
// isn't declared yet). This is a minimal environment that is prone to
// having more pitfalls than normal.
//
// Avoid doing things at root-level init-time, if possible.
//
// About the file-scoped variables:
// File-scoped variables do not get placed into the enclosing namespace,
// but are instead placed into the GLOBAL namespace (no, not $GLOBALS, that's different).
//
// This is different from how every other PHP symbol type interacts with namespaces!
//
// Do not use file-scoped variables. (In init scripts, or anywhere else really.)
//
// Within initscripts, use functions and constants instead.
// Outside of initscripts, classes are the preferred way to do everything.
// In either case, always declare the namespace at the top of every file.
//
// If you need to use variables for miscellaneous computation, then
// declare a function and do the computation inside the function.
//
// If you need a variable that has global state and accessibility
// (kind of like a static property on a class, but without a class declaration),
// then declare it as a static variable inside an accessor function.
// See the `trace_indent_lvl()` function in `Kickback\InitializationScripts\trace.php`
// for an example of this technique.
//

* This function accesses a constant.
*
* It is useful for circumventing "Strict comparison ... will always evaluate to (true|false)."
