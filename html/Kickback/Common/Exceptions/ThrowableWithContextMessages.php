    /**
    * Cause uncaught throwable to emit `$msg` before `getMessage()`.
    *
    * More specifically: this affects the output of `__toString()`,
    * which is what PHP calls when emitting error messages due to
    * uncaught exceptions.
    *
    * This is useful for providing context to more specific errors
    * that are emitted by called functions.
    *
    * Example:
    * ```
    *   // Testing framework logic for scanning a project for tests.
    *   // Here we open a directory that may contain .PHP files to scan.
    *   try {
    *       $dir = Directory::open($directory_path);
    *   } catch(\IKickbackException $e) {
    *       $class_shortname = str_replace(__NAMESPACE__ . '\\', '', __CLASS__);
    *
    *       $e->say_before_message(fn() =>
    *           "$class_shortname attempted to scan for .PHP files ".
    *           'containing tests, but encountered an error:');
    *
    *       throw $e;
    *   }
    * ```
    *
    * In this example, the `Directory::open` function can throw a number
    * of exceptions (usually `IO_IException`-type exceptions, but we are
    * catching even more if possible). `Directory::open` can emit an
    * accurate message about the exact nature of what went wrong
    * _with the filesystem_, but it has no idea _why_ we wanted to open
    * a directory in the first place.
    *
    * Meanwhile, the caller knows that we're opening a directory because
    * we are scanning for tests. But, the caller does NOT know exactly
    * what went wrong with the filesystem operation(s).
    *
    * Ideally, an error message should provide BOTH sets of information:
    * the higher-level "what/why", and the lower-level "how/where".
    *
    * The `say_before_message` and `say_after_message` methods provide a way
    * to do exactly that: place high level and low level information together
    * in an error message.
    *
    * The `__toString()` method will print the file basename and line number
    * for each method. It will not print the full file path, nor will it
    * print the function name. This is for the sake of brevity, as the
    * additional information would make it difficult to read the exception
    * messages.
    *
    * If explicitly providing a file and/or line number, then the
    * `$in_function` parameter is required. Although it isn't printed,
    * it is still used to determine the correct order in which to
    * print the "before" messages:
    * * Messages from the same function will print as they appear
    *     in the function: top to bottom.
    * * Messages from different functions will be printed in "stack"
    *     order: each call to `say_before_message` treats any previous
    *     calls to `say_before_message` as part of the "message",
    *     so earlier calls will print closer to the "main" message.
    *
    * @see say_after_message
