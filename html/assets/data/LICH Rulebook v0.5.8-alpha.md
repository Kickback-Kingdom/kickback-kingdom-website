# Game Setup {#game-setup}

## The Board {#the-board}

### Dimensions {#dimensions}

LICH is played on a hexagonal board with an hexagonal grid. Each side of the board consists of 6 hexagons.

### Starting Positions {#starting-positions}

Starting positions are designated as the 6 corners of the boards.

### Board Pieces {#board-pieces}

#### 	Source Stones {#source-stones}

* Source Stones are placed on [the board](#the-board) before play.  
* Whenever an [Avatar](#avatars) occupies the same tile as a Source Stone, that Avatar’s controller must [draw](#draw) 1 [pure source](#pure-sources) from their [deck](#deck) if they are able.  
* [Summons](#summons) treat Source Stones as [walls](#walls) except for [line of sight](#line-of-sight-|-targeting).  
* Source Stones do not impede [line of sight](#line-of-sight-|-targeting).

#### 	Walls {#walls}

* [Avatars](#avatars) and [Summons](#summons) may not occupy wall tiles.  
* Walls block [line of sight](#line-of-sight-|-targeting).  
* Walls are placed according to map setup before play.

#### 	Avatars {#avatars}

* Avatars represent their controller’s [hero](#heroes) on [the board](#the-board).

#### 	Summon Pieces {#summon-pieces}

* Summon pieces come in pairs of matching design/color.  
* They are used as the representation of the summoned [target](#targets) and as the marker for the [summoning card](#summons), linking it to the [target](#targets) on [the board](#the-board).

#### 	Surface Tiles {#surface-tiles}

* Surfaces Tiles are placed on [the board](#the-board) to represent the [surface](#surfaces) that occupies that tile.

### Fields {#fields}

	Each player has their own field in which their cards and decks sit.

#### 	Action Zone {#action-zone}

* The action zone consists of 5 action slots. Each slot may hold one [action card](#action-cards).   
* It is public knowledge at all times

#### 	Deck {#deck}

* The deck is where cards are drawn from; especially at the [end of each turn](#end-phase).   
* The deck is kept face down and not able to be freely looked through.

#### 	Purgatory {#purgatory}

* [Destroyed](#destroy), [Discarded](#discard), or [Attrited](#attrit) cards go to the controller’s Purgatory.   
* All purgatories are public knowledge at all times.

#### 	Abyss {#abyss}

* All Abysses are public knowledge at all times.

#### 	Hero Zone {#hero-zone}

	Each player has their own hand which is private from all other players, not on their team.  
		

## Initialization {#initialization}

### Board Setup {#board-setup}

	The board is set up according to the to-be-played map

### Offering to the Lich {#offering-to-the-lich}

#### 	Base Offering {#base-offering}

* All players draw three (3) cards from their deck and choose one to ‘offer to the Lich’  
  1. The chosen card is placed face down onto the board to signify that it has been chosen  
* After all players have chosen a card, all chosen cards are flipped face up. The player whose chosen card has the highest total source cost goes first in turn order. Turn order proceeds clockwise from this player.

#### 	First Tie Breaker {#first-tie-breaker}

* If there is a tie during the base offering, all tying players return their [hand](#the-hand) and chosen card to their [decks](#deck), shuffle their [decks](#deck), and [draw](#draw) three (3) new cards.  
* The tying players then chose another card in the same way.  
* Once all tying players have chosen a card, they are flipped face up. The player whose chosen card has the highest [source cost](#card-source-cost) goes first and turn order follows clockwise from this player.

#### 	Sudden Death {#sudden-death}

* If there is still a tie, tying players return their chosen and non-chosen cards to their [decks](#deck), and shuffle their [decks](#deck).  
* The tying players then [draw](#draw) cards, one at a time together, off the top of their deck, comparing [source cost](#card-source-cost) until a winner is determined. If, at any time during this process, one player does not win while the other players tie, this player does not continue with the tie breaker process.

#### 	End of Offering {#end-of-offering}
